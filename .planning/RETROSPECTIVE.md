## Milestone: v1.0 — MVP

**Shipped:** 2026-04-19
**Phases:** 5 (of 6 planned) | **Plans:** 26 | **Tasks:** 36
**Timeline:** 5 days (2026-04-10 → 2026-04-15 active dev, archived 2026-04-19)
**Codebase:** 222 files changed, ~45k insertions, 7,958 LOC TypeScript, 157 commits

### What Was Built
- Full visual polish pass with theme system, responsive layouts, and collection balance charts
- Preference-aware similarity engine with complicationExceptions, collectionGoal, and gap-fill scoring
- Wishlist intelligence: deal flags, target prices, Good Deals + Sleeping Beauties insight panels
- Cloud persistence via Supabase Postgres + Drizzle ORM, replacing localStorage entirely
- Authentication with Supabase Auth, proxy.ts enforcement, and double-verified DAL/Server Actions
- Server Component migration: all pages are async Server Components, Zustand demoted to 31-line filter-only store
- Production deployment at horlo.app with verified deploy runbook hardened by 6 real footguns

### What Worked
- **Wave-based parallel execution** reduced Phase 5 wall-clock time significantly — independent plans ran in parallel within waves
- **Grep gates in VALIDATION.md** caught structural regressions before verification; the 7-gate pattern was reliable
- **Runbook-then-execute pattern** (Plan 05-02 writes, 05-06 executes with checkpoint) caught 6 footguns that would have been undocumented tribal knowledge
- **Test suite grew organically** during feature phases (2-4) rather than being deferred to the end — 697 tests by Phase 5 without a dedicated test phase
- **Server Component conversion** was cleanest when done page-by-page with explicit grep gates validating each migration

### What Was Inefficient
- **ROADMAP Progress table** was never maintained by executor agents — `roadmap update-plan-progress` subcommand doesn't exist in gsd-tools, so the table said "0/Not started" for every phase
- **SUMMARY.md one-liner extraction** produced garbage for most plans (literal "One-liner:" text) — the template field was rarely filled meaningfully by executors
- **Phase 6 scoped too early** — TEST-04/05/06 requirements were written before the test suite existed; by Phase 5, 697 tests were already passing and the success criteria partially overlapped with work already done
- **IPv6-only Supabase direct-connect** was not documented anywhere and cost debugging time; this is a Supabase platform change that their own docs don't flag prominently

### Patterns Established
- `proxy.ts` + DAL double-verification as the auth enforcement pattern (Next.js 16 specific)
- `filterWatches()` as a pure function extracted from store state — pattern for keeping computation testable when migrating from client to server
- `CollectionView` / `PreferencesClient` as the Server Component → client handoff wrappers
- Session-mode pooler URL for both migrations and runtime (avoids IPv6-only direct-connect)
- Checkpoint plans (`autonomous: false`) for prod-touching operations

### Key Lessons
1. **Run the runbook yourself before shipping it.** Plan 05-02 wrote a correct-looking runbook; Plan 05-06 found 6 real problems by actually executing it. The runbook doubled in size from the fixes.
2. **grep gates > unit tests for migration verification.** When converting pages from client to server, a grep for `'use client'` in `src/app/` catches regressions that type-checking misses.
3. **Supabase free-tier email is essentially unusable for signup flows** — 2/hour rate limit, domain MX validation rejects throwaways. Either disable confirmation or configure custom SMTP before smoke testing.
4. **`vercel link` overwrites `.env.local`** — back up before running on an existing project.

### Cost Observations
- Model mix: ~70% Sonnet (executor agents), ~30% Opus (orchestration, verification, code review)
- Sessions: ~5 active development sessions across 5 days
- Notable: Phase 5 execution (6 plans) completed in a single Opus session including the prod deploy checkpoint

## Cross-Milestone Trends

### Process Evolution

| Milestone | Timeline | Phases | Key Change |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| v1.0 | 5 days | 5/6 | First milestone — established GSD workflow patterns |

### Cumulative Quality

| Milestone | Tests | Coverage | Phase 6 Debt |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| v1.0 | 697 | Not configured | TEST-04/05/06 deferred |

### Top Lessons (Verified Across Milestones)

1. Run production runbooks manually before declaring them verified — the gap between "looks correct" and "actually works" is always larger than expected.
