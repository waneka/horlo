# Horlo

## What This Is

A taste-aware watch collection intelligence system for personal collectors. Users manage their collection and wishlist, understand how their watches relate to each other, and make more intentional buying decisions. The core insight engine evaluates any watch against the user's collection and preferences to produce a semantic label (Core Fit, Role Duplicate, Hard Mismatch, etc.) rather than a raw score.

Shipped as a cloud-backed, authenticated web app at [horlo.app](https://horlo.app) — data persists across devices and browsers via Supabase Postgres.

## Core Value

A collector can evaluate any watch against their collection and get a meaningful, preference-aware answer about whether it adds something or just duplicates what they already own.

## Current State

**Shipped:** v3.0 Production Nav & Daily Wear Loop (2026-04-27)

Production navigation frame, three-tier wear privacy, notifications system, photo-first WYWT post flow with `/wear/[id]` detail route, and people search are all live. 51/51 v3.0 requirements satisfied at code level. See `.planning/milestones/v3.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` for the audit (status: `tech_debt` — no blockers, 31 deferred UAT items + ~30 advisory items).

**Active:** v4.0 Discovery & Polish — Phase 23 Settings Sections + Schema-Field UI complete (2026-05-01). SET-07/08/09/10/11/12 + FEAT-07/08 satisfied: `<CollectionGoalCard>` and `<OverlapToleranceCard>` lifted to top of Preferences tab (Brand Loyalist option added with locked em-dash copy "Brand Loyalist — Same maker, different models"); `<PreferencesClient>` accepts `embedded` prop suppressing h1/subtitle/container when rendered inside Settings tab; `<AppearanceSection>` mounts existing `<InlineThemeSegmented>` inside `<SettingsSection title="Theme">` (Server Component renders Client child per Next.js 16 — UserMenu segmented control retained, both surfaces sync via `horlo-theme` cookie); `<WatchForm>` exposes `isChronometer` Checkbox in Specifications card with locked label "Chronometer-certified (COSC or equivalent)" and Public/Private pill below Notes textarea (matches `<NoteVisibilityPill>` chip shape; default true matches DB default); `<WatchDetail>` renders only-if-true Certification row with lucide `Check` icon at `text-foreground` (Anti-Pattern 9 honored — informational fact, not affordance); `addWatch`/`editWatch` Zod schema accepts `notesPublic`; both Server Actions revalidate `'/u/[username]', 'layout'` for cross-page sync with the per-row pill on /u/{username}/notes (D-19). SET-09/SET-11/SET-12 verified-no-change (Phase 22 D-01/D-15 already satisfied); D-20 cleanup grep sweep returned ZERO orphans from Phase 22's stub deletions. Zero schema changes, zero new DAL functions; all 8 PHASE_REQ_IDs satisfied; 5 manual UAT items approved by user. 6 plans in 2 waves: Wave 0/1 (RED scaffolds + Preferences top Cards + Appearance Theme card + WatchForm/Detail field exposure parallelized with worktrees) + Wave 2 (Server Action wiring + verification doc).

**Previous:** Phase 22 Settings Restructure + Account Section complete (2026-05-01). SET-01..SET-06 satisfied via base-ui vertical tabs shell with hash routing, Account section email/password change flows wired to Supabase `updateUser`, `/auth/confirm/route.ts` 5-type EmailOtpType switch with redirect map, `/preferences` server-side redirect to `/settings#preferences`.

**Previous:** Phase 20 Collection Fit Surface Polish + Verdict Copy complete (2026-04-30). FIT-01..FIT-04 satisfied: pure-renderer `<CollectionFitCard>` (no engine imports — static guard at `tests/static/CollectionFitCard.no-engine.test.ts`) replaces `<SimilarityBadge>` (deleted) across three surfaces — `/watch/[id]` (server-component compute, D-03 static-surface), `/search` row inline-expand accordion backed by `getVerdictForCatalogWatch` Server Action with `useWatchSearchVerdictCache` client hook (D-06 / FIT-04, eliminates the dangling `/evaluate?catalogId=` link — `/evaluate` route does not exist), and new canonical `/catalog/[catalogId]` route (D-10) which `DiscoveryWatchCard` now points to. Verdict substrate at `src/lib/verdict/`: 12-template composer (4 D-01 roadmap-mandated + 8 supporting), confidence gate at 0.5/0.7 thresholds (D-14 from 19.1), null-tolerant `computeViewerTasteProfile` Drizzle aggregate over `watches_catalog` (confidence ≥ 0.5 SQL filter, Pitfall 4), `catalogEntryToSimilarityInput` shim preserving D-09 byte-lock on `analyzeSimilarity` (HEAD shasum unchanged from pre-phase base 969af09). 27 verdict-substrate tests + 8 RTL renderer tests + 4 watch-page integration tests + 5 catalog-page integration tests + 22 search-accordion tests = 72/72 Phase 20 tests green. Production build compiles successfully (4.3s, 27/27 static pages).

Phase 20 had a partial run interrupted by a computer crash mid-Wave 3; recovery surfaced a workflow `git reset --soft` bug in worktree-base detection that produced a 43k-line destructive first commit on the 20-05 branch (caught and rolled back; intended files extracted surgically into 411339a). Three small inline gap-closure fixes after verifier run: viewerTasteProfile import (build blocker — `PrimaryArchetype`/`EraSignal` were not re-exported from verdict types barrel), spy signature TS2556 in composer/confidence tests, and missing `collectionRevision` prop in two SearchPageClient parallel test files.

**Previous:** Phase 19.1 Catalog Taste Enrichment complete (2026-04-29). 8 LLM-derived taste columns on `watches_catalog`, `catalog-source-photos` Supabase bucket, `src/lib/taste/` service module (Anthropic claude-sonnet-4-6 strict tool-use), `updateCatalogTaste` first-write-wins DAL helper, fire-and-forget enrichment from `addWatch` + `/api/extract-watch`, Reference Photo Card on `mode='create'` (D-19), `WatchForm` strips Style/Role/Design pickers (D-18), `scripts/backfill-taste.ts` + `scripts/reenrich-taste.ts`. 22/22 D-XX decisions verified; 31 unit/component + 26 live-DB integration + 4 API + 2 backfill tests green.

**Previous:** Phase 19 /search Watches + Collections complete (2026-04-28). 7/7 SRCH requirements satisfied; 116 unit + RTL tests green + 2 live-DB integration tests green.

## Current Milestone: v4.0 Discovery & Polish

**Goal:** Finish v3.0-era stubs, expose schema-driven knobs that already exist behind the scenes, surface the similarity engine as a first-class evaluation flow, and lay the canonical watch catalog foundation that unblocks future cross-user features.

**Target features:**

- `/explore` discovery surface (popular collectors, taste clusters, trending watches)
- `/search` Watches tab backed by a new canonical `watches_catalog` table (per-user `watches` link to it; migration + backfill)
- `/search` Collections tab — search across collections by tag/role/brand
- Settings expansion — Account (email/password), Notification opt-out toggles, Appearance — beyond privacy-only today
- Preferences UI for `collectionGoal` + `overlapTolerance` (drives similarity thresholds; hidden from form today)
- Owner edit surface for `notesPublic` per-note visibility
- `isChronometer` toggle in WatchForm + display in WatchDetail
- Profile prominence — top-nav avatar shortcut, not buried in dropdown
- Collection Fit reframe — richer contextual verdict copy + cross-user surface polish + verdict-as-step inside the rethought add-watch flow (no standalone /evaluate route)
- Empty-state CTAs across collection / wishlist / notes / worn
- WYWT post-submit auto-nav to `/wear/[id]` (celebration moment)
- Form feedback polish — success toasts, pending states, contextual URL-extract errors
- Remove `price_drop` + `trending_collector` notification stubs (dead code cleanup)
- Custom SMTP + email confirmation ON
- Test fixture cleanup (9 files w/ `wornPublic` references) + TEST-04/05/06

**Out of scope:** WristOverlaySvg geometry redesign, AI recommendation engine, automated price tracking, collection visualization map.

- [ ] Integration test for POST /api/extract-watch route handler — carried from v1.0 (TEST-05)
- [ ] Component tests for WatchForm, FilterBar, WatchCard — carried from v1.0 (TEST-06)
- [ ] WristOverlaySvg geometry redesign — user owns; canonical 10:10 + arm spacing fix (v3.0 deferred UAT)
- [ ] WYWT post-submit auto-navigation to `/wear/[wearEventId]` — currently dialog closes with toast only (v3.0 deferred UX enhancement)
- [ ] 31 v3.0 deferred human-verification UAT items (iOS device tests, multi-session flows, FOUC checks, prod browser smoke tests) — see `.planning/milestones/v3.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

### Out of Scope

- Social / community features — partial: v2.0 Phase 7-10 shipped public profiles, follow graph, Common Ground overlap, and the 5-section Network Home (activity feed, WYWT, recommendations, insights, suggested collectors)
- Automated price tracking / market integrations / deal alerts — future milestone, significant infrastructure
- AI recommendation engine (best gap filler, most versatile addition) — future milestone after auth/data layer is solid
- Collection visualization map (2D dressy↔sporty × affordable↔expensive plot) — future milestone
- Sharing / export to others — future milestone once multi-user is established

## Context

**Current state (post v3.0):** Next.js 16 App Router with `cacheComponents: true`, React 19, TypeScript 5 strict, Supabase Auth + Postgres with RLS enabled project-wide (DEBT-02 audited), Drizzle ORM, Tailwind CSS 4 with IBM Plex Sans, Shadcn/base-ui + Sonner. 2813+ tests passing / 152 skipped (env-gated integration), 87+ test files. 21,311 LOC TypeScript in `src/`. Deployed at horlo.app on Vercel; production navigation frame, three-tier wear privacy, notifications system, photo-first WYWT flow, and people search are all live.

**Architecture:** Server Components by default, Zustand demoted to filter-only ephemeral state (31 lines), server-only DAL for all data access, Server Actions for all mutations, proxy.ts enforces auth at the edge, double-verified in every DAL function and Server Action. Two-layer privacy (RLS at DB + DAL WHERE clauses) protects follower/followee reads. Root layout uses inline theme script + Suspense around dynamic children to satisfy Next 16 Cache Components.

**Production:** Supabase project `wdntzsckjaoqodsyscns`, Vercel deployment at `horlo.app`/`www.horlo.app`. Email confirmation ON (via Resend SMTP at `mail.horlo.app`, flipped 2026-04-30 in Phase 21). Drizzle migrations tracked; production RLS policies (including `activities_select_own_or_followed`) pushed via `supabase db push --linked --include-all`. Deploy runbook: `docs/deploy-db-setup.md`.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js 16 App Router — continue with existing framework, no rewrites
- **Data model**: Watch and UserPreferences types are established — extend, don't break existing structure
- **Personal first**: Single-user experience and data isolation must remain correct even after multi-user auth is added
- **Performance**: Target <500 watches per user; no need for complex pagination or infinite scroll in MVP

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Local-first with localStorage | Zero backend complexity for MVP, fast iteration | ✓ Completed migration — localStorage replaced by Supabase Postgres in v1.0 |
| URL import with LLM extraction | Product vision said "no external APIs" but the feature was built and adds real value | ✓ Good — SSRF hardened in Phase 1, auth-gated in Phase 4 |
| Semantic similarity labels over raw scores | Scores are confusing; collector language (Core Fit, Role Duplicate) is more actionable | ✓ Good |
| Zustand for state | Simple, no boilerplate, works well with localStorage persist | ✓ Resolved — demoted to filter-only (31 lines) in Phase 5; DB is source of truth |
| App Router only, no pages/ | Clean separation, server components where possible | ✓ Good |
| Supabase Auth + Postgres + Drizzle | Integrated auth+DB, free tier sufficient for personal use, Drizzle for type-safe queries | ✓ Good — deployed and verified in prod |
| DAL + Server Actions (not API routes) | Colocation of data access with auth verification, better type safety | ✓ Good — single POST route remains for extract-watch only |
| proxy.ts + double-verified auth | Defense in depth: proxy.ts for redirects, DAL/SA for data access | ✓ Good — tested via Phase 4 UAT |
| Email confirmation OFF | Personal-MVP posture; free-tier SMTP limited to 2/hour | ✓ Resolved — flipped ON 2026-04-30 in Phase 21 via custom Resend SMTP on `mail.horlo.app` (DKIM+SPF+DMARC verified; D-07 round-trip gate passed). Backout in `docs/deploy-db-setup.md` "Phase 21 — Custom SMTP via Resend Backout". |
| Session-mode pooler for migrations | Direct-connect host is IPv6-only, unreachable on most home ISPs | ✓ Good — documented in runbook |
| Two-layer privacy (RLS + DAL WHERE) | Single-layer is fragile; if one breaks, data leaks. Enforce at both layers so either breaking alone is still caught | ✓ Good — shipped in v2.0 Phase 6-10; integration tests in `tests/integration/home-privacy.test.ts` exercise the combined guarantee |
| No Supabase Realtime in v2.0 | Free tier limit of 200 concurrent WebSockets; server-rendered + `router.refresh()` is sufficient at MVP scale | ✓ Good — v2.0 shipped without it; revisit if user scale grows |
| Per-user independent watch entries (no canonical watch table) | Canonical normalization adds huge product complexity; per-user entries ship faster and let the UI/DAL compose views | ✓ Good — shipped in v2.0; revisit in a future "data strategy" phase if social features need cross-user watch identity |
| Cache Components (`cacheComponents: true`) with inline theme script | Next.js 16 `cacheComponents` forbids `cookies()` in layout body; canonical shadcn/next-themes inline `<script>` in `<head>` is the zero-FOUC escape hatch | ✓ Good — shipped in Phase 10; Suspense wraps Header + main |
| Rule-based recommendations (no LLM) in v2.0 | Keep the home page rendereable without API keys; 5 priority-ordered rationale templates produce deterministic, testable output | ✓ Good — shipped; revisit if product needs richer personalization |
| Viewer-aware DAL for cross-user reads | Different functions for owner-only (`getWatchById`) vs viewer-aware (`getWatchByIdForViewer`) keeps edit/delete paths strictly owner-scoped while allowing public views of public profiles | ✓ Good — pattern established in quick-260421-rdb; mirror for any future cross-user read |
| Three-tier wear visibility (public/followers/private) per row instead of `worn_public` boolean | Per-row visibility lets users mix public + followers-only + private wears on the same profile; tab-level boolean was too coarse | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 11 (schema + backfill) + Phase 12 (DAL ripple + column drop). Two-layer privacy preserved (RLS + DAL WHERE) |
| Default wear visibility: Public | Override researcher recommendation; explicitly chosen by user. Default-to-Public + clear UI copy is the safety net against confirmation-dialog friction | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 15 |
| Client-direct wear photo upload pipeline | Browser → Supabase Storage with user's session; Server Action validates storage key + inserts row. Avoids doubling bandwidth and Next.js 4MB body limit | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 15; orphan-cleanup on row-insert failure (23505 + non-23505) |
| Sonner Toaster bound to custom `ThemeProvider` (NOT next-themes) | Horlo's existing ThemeProvider is the single source of truth; binding to next-themes would fork theme state | ✓ Good — `ThemedToaster` Client Component shipped in v3.0 Phase 15 |
| `getWornTodayIdsForUser` preflight in WYWT picker + 23505 server catch | Two-layer defense against duplicate-day wears: client disables already-worn watches, server enforces UNIQUE constraint | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 15 |
| `revalidateTag(viewer:${id}, 'max')` for cross-user notification fan-out vs `updateTag` for self-reads | Read-your-own-writes via `updateTag()` (immediate); SWR semantics via `revalidateTag('max')` for OTHER users (recipient sees dot within 30s TTL) | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 13 |
| Fire-and-forget notification logger | Notification insert failure must never block follow / addWatch primary commit; same pattern as `logActivity` | ✓ Good — `logNotification` with internal try/catch + opt-out + self-guard shipped in v3.0 Phase 13 |
| Cradle-style elevated Wear CTA in mobile bottom nav (no SVG cutout) | Stacking-context simplicity > true notch cutout at v3.0 scale; visual elevation via translate + shadow achieves Figma intent | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 14 |
| Shared `PUBLIC_PATHS` constant for proxy + 3 nav surfaces | Single source of truth eliminates drift between auth gate and nav rendering | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 14 |
| pg_trgm GIN indexes for people search | Cost model picks Seq Scan at <127 rows but Bitmap Index Scan available at production scale (forced-plan EXPLAIN ANALYZE proves indexes are reachable) | ✓ Good — shipped in v3.0 Phase 11 + 16; production trajectory verified |

### v4.0 Phase 17 — Catalog Foundation

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Canonical `watches_catalog` table reverses v2.0 "no canonical watch table" decision | v4.0 needs cross-user identity for /search Watches, /explore Trending, /search Collections, /evaluate?catalogId= deep-link | Adds a second source of truth; CAT-11 splits SPEC fields (catalog) vs OWNERSHIP fields (per-user `watches`) at display-JOIN time |
| `watches.catalog_id` is NULLABLE INDEFINITELY in v4.0 — never `SET NOT NULL` | Backfill safety; URL-extract failures or orphaned data should leave the user's collection intact | Future v5+ phase (CAT-14) will SET NOT NULL after 100% backfill verified across two consecutive deploys |
| `watches_catalog` deliberate departure from two-layer privacy: public-read RLS, service-role-write ONLY | The catalog is silent infrastructure; per-user privacy is enforced on `watches` rows, not on catalog identity | Asymmetry is intentional and documented; new pattern in this codebase. v5+ admin tooling will be the only other writer. |
| `analyzeSimilarity()` is NOT modified in v4.0 — catalog is silent infrastructure | Avoids regression risk in the core value prop; current scoring works against per-user `watches` data which is unchanged | Future v5+ phase (CAT-13) migrates similarity engine to JOIN catalog at read time; tag taxonomy audit phase must land first |
| pg_cron daily refresh at 03:00 UTC + manual `npm run db:refresh-counts` for local dev | Off-peak refresh; local Docker doesn't ship pg_cron | Counts may be up to 24h stale (acceptable for "trending" / "gaining traction" surfaces) |
| source CHECK constraint NOT pgEnum — avoids ALTER TYPE ADD/DROP VALUE pain | Phase 24 ENUM cleanup proved rename-and-recreate is the costly path | Evolution = ALTER TABLE DROP/ADD CONSTRAINT (cheaper); literal union maintained manually in `src/lib/types.ts` |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state

*Last updated: 2026-05-01 — Phase 23 (Settings Sections + Schema-Field UI) complete. SET-07/08/09/10/11/12 + FEAT-07/08 satisfied: collectionGoal + overlapTolerance lifted to top of Preferences tab as dedicated Cards (Brand Loyalist option added with locked em-dash copy); PreferencesClient gains embedded prop suppressing page chrome inside Settings tab; AppearanceSection mounts InlineThemeSegmented in SettingsSection title="Theme" (Server-renders-Client child per Next.js 16; UserMenu retains its segmented control — both sync via horlo-theme cookie); WatchForm exposes isChronometer Checkbox and notesPublic Public/Private pill below Notes textarea; WatchDetail renders only-if-true Certification row with text-foreground Check icon (Anti-Pattern 9 honored); addWatch/editWatch Zod accepts notesPublic and revalidates /u/[username] layout for cross-page sync (D-19); SET-09/SET-11/SET-12 verified-no-change via Phase 22 D-01/D-15; D-20 cleanup grep ZERO orphans. Zero schema changes, zero new DAL functions; 6 plans in 2 worktree-parallelized waves; 5 manual UAT items approved. Up next: Phase 24 (Notification Stub Cleanup + Test Fixture & Carryover).*

*Previous: 2026-04-28 — Phase 19 (/search Watches + Collections) complete. 7/7 SRCH requirements satisfied; 116 unit + RTL tests green + 2 live-DB integration tests green; 8 advisory findings in 19-REVIEW.md (3 warning + 5 info, all sub-Critical and non-blocking).*

*Previous: 2026-04-27 — Phase 17 (Catalog Foundation) complete. `watches_catalog` + `watches_catalog_daily_snapshots` tables shipped with public-read RLS, generated normalization columns, pg_trgm GIN indexes, and a named NULLS NOT DISTINCT unique constraint. DAL upserters wired into `addWatch` + `/api/extract-watch` (fire-and-forget; catalog failure cannot block the user). Idempotent batched backfill via `npm run db:backfill-catalog`. Daily refresh: SECDEF function (anon=f, authed=f, service=t) scheduled by pg_cron at 03:00 UTC in prod, mirrored locally by `npm run db:refresh-counts`. 12/12 CAT-NN requirements; 56/56 integration tests green; 0 critical / 4 warning / 4 info from code review. `analyzeSimilarity()` byte-identical (silent infrastructure honored). Up next: Phase 18 /explore Discovery Surface.*

*Previous: 2026-04-26 — v4.0 Discovery & Polish milestone started. Goal: finish v3.0-era stubs (/explore, /search Watches, /search Collections, Settings expansion), expose schema-driven knobs (collectionGoal, overlapTolerance, notesPublic, isChronometer), surface the similarity engine as a first-class "Evaluate this watch" flow, raise profile prominence, ship empty-state CTAs + WYWT auto-nav + form polish, and lay the canonical `watches_catalog` table that unblocks future cross-user features. Carryover: custom SMTP + email confirmation ON, test fixture cleanup, TEST-04/05/06. Cleanup: remove price_drop + trending_collector notification stub dead code. Up next: research → requirements → roadmap.*

*Previous: 2026-04-27 after v3.0 milestone — Production Nav & Daily Wear Loop shipped. 7 phases (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 999.1), 37 plans, 56 tasks, 178 commits over 5 days; 51/51 v3.0 requirements satisfied at code level. Schema + storage foundation, three-tier wear privacy ripple, notifications system, production navigation frame (mobile BottomNav + SlimTopNav + DesktopTopNav with shared PUBLIC_PATHS gate), photo-first WYWT post flow with `/wear/[id]` detail route, and people search with pg_trgm-backed live debounced results all live. Audit status: `tech_debt` — 31 deferred human-verification UAT items + ~30 advisory items, none blocking. See `.planning/milestones/v3.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.*

*Previous: 2026-04-24 — Phase 14 (Nav Shell + Explore Stub) complete. Production navigation frame shipped: mobile BottomNav (5-item sticky bar, 80px tall, shrink-0 Wear cradle with 12px natural overflow above the bar, all 5 labels share a bottom baseline); desktop Header delegator split into SlimTopNav (<768px) / DesktopTopNav (≥768px); legacy `MobileNav.tsx` deleted (NAV-12); `/explore` + `/search` stubs close nav-link 404s; `/insights` retired to owner-only profile tab with two-layer P-08 privacy defense; profile dropdown consolidated via `InlineThemeSegmented` (D-17) with base-ui dismissal guard on the theme buttons; Settings routes to `/preferences` as sole v3.0 entry point (D-12); shared `PUBLIC_PATHS` constant + `isPublicPath` predicate unify proxy + nav auth gate (NAV-05 D-21/D-22); IBM Plex Sans + `viewport-fit=cover` metadata added. DEBT-01 regression-locked. 5 human UAT items resolved. 2489 tests pass, 0 regressions. Code review: 0 critical, 3 warnings, 5 info (non-blocking, tracked in 14-REVIEW.md). Up next: Phase 15 (WYWT Photo Post Flow).*
