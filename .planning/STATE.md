# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-25 — v7.0 roadmap created)

**Core value:** A collector can evaluate any watch against their collection and get a meaningful, preference-aware answer about whether it adds something or just duplicates what they already own.
**Current focus:** Phase 61 — photo-upload-+-carousel-ui (next; Phase 60 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 61
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-25

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33% (2/6 phases — 59, 60 complete)

## Performance Metrics

- v6.0: 8 phases (53-58 + 56A + 57.1), 37 plans, 3 days
- 34/34 v6.0 requirements shipped
- Blockers encountered: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- **Variant C is a hard cutover** (operator decision 2026-05-25) — legacy `/watch/[id]` + `/catalog/[catalogId]` routes are REMOVED (no redirect); un-migrated links fail loudly; CI guard is the completeness guarantee (ROUTE-03).
- **`watches_catalog` is NOT wipeable** — in-place ALTER only for photo schema; data migrations keyed by (brand, model, reference), not id (ids diverge local/prod).
- **`workflow.use_worktrees = false` is permanent** — this project is build-gated + DB-touching; `.env.local` unavailable in worktrees.
- **DB migrations**: `drizzle-kit push` LOCAL ONLY; prod uses `supabase db push --linked`.
- **Phase ordering is locked**: 59 (route merge) → 60 (photo schema/DAL) → 61 (photo UI) → 62 (wear pics surfacing) → 63 (grid engagement, depends on 59 only) → 64 (IA redesign, depends on 61+62+63).
- **`unstable_instant = false` on `/u/[username]/[tab]` is PERMANENT** — do not re-enable (Phase 52 lesson).
- **Phase 64 must preserve Phase 51/52 Cache Components structure** — CommentThread stays an uncached Suspense sibling.
- **OtherOwnersRoster + CatalogPageActions on unified route are cross-user only** — gated on `!isOwner` per spike §4.D; Phase 64 IA redesign resolves definitively.
- **Build-gate proven (ROUTE-03/D-11)** — `npm run build` exits 1 with any `/watch/${` literal; exits 0 clean. Vercel will block deploys with missed link migrations.
- **Tests for deleted legacy pages removed** — `tests/app/catalog-page.test.ts` and `tests/app/watch-page-verdict.test.ts` deleted (imported the now-deleted pages); unified route integration coverage in `tests/integration/phase59-unified-route.test.ts` from Plan 01.
- **watch_photos Supabase migration is authoritative** — backfill + lossless assert + DROP COLUMN + RLS + bucket live in `20260525000000_phase60_watch_photos.sql`; Drizzle migration `0013_phase60_watch_photos.sql` is local-sync only; prod push is Plan 04.
- **src/data/watches.ts temporarily broken on row.imageUrl** — RESOLVED in Plan 03 (mappers repointed; cover subquery across all 3 read paths).
- **Cover subquery returns raw storagePath** — Phase 61 signs URLs; DAL stays admin-client-free (D-04/D-06 Open Q1 decision).

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 60 COMPLETE — all 4 plans, verification passed (10/10 must-haves), prod migration applied + verified.

## Session Continuity

Last activity: 2026-05-25 — Phase 60 COMPLETE. watch_photos schema + authoritative Supabase migration (backfill→lossless DO $$ assert→DROP watches.image_url→RLS→watch-photos bucket); watch-photos storage helper + SC4 EXIF test; cover-resolving DAL (correlated subquery across all 3 read paths) + cap(10)/reorder/delete + full image_url blast-radius repoint + purgeWatchPhotos; prod migration applied via `supabase db push --linked` (operator-run + verified). Post-merge gate: build exit 0, suite green (1 pre-existing CommentGateLocked font-medium failure, unrelated to Phase 60). Verification: passed.
Stopped at: Phase 61 context gathered
Next action: Phase 61 — photo-upload-+-carousel-ui (discuss or plan)
