# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-26 — v4.0 milestone started)

**Core value:** A collector can evaluate any watch against their collection and get a meaningful, preference-aware answer about whether it adds something or just duplicates what they already own.
**Current focus:** Phase 20 — collection-fit-surface-polish-verdict-copy

## Current Position

Phase: 20 (collection-fit-surface-polish-verdict-copy) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 6
Status: Executing Phase 20
Last activity: 2026-04-30 -- Phase 20 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 19.1 inserted after Phase 19: Catalog Taste Enrichment (URGENT) — LLM-derived structured taste attribute extraction on `watches_catalog` (formality, sportiness, heritage_score, primary_archetype, era_signal, design_motifs[], crowd_signals[], confidence). Hides `styleTags`/`roleTags`/`designTraits` pickers from `WatchForm`. Adds photo upload + multi-modal vision call on manual entry. Inserted because Phase 20 verdict copy depends on these signals; engine rewire (`analyzeSimilarity` reading catalog taste attrs) deferred to v5.0. Architecture decision in memory at `project_taste_enrichment_arch_2026_04_29.md`.

### Carried Forward

The full Key Decisions log lives in `.planning/PROJECT.md` (Key Decisions table) and per-milestone retrospective in `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`. Active todos and tech debt now live in PROJECT.md `### Active`. Milestone archives live in `.planning/milestones/`.

Recent decisions affecting v4.0 work:

- Catalog `catalog_id` is **nullable indefinitely** in v4.0 (NEVER `SET NOT NULL` — defer to v5.0+)
- Catalog is **silent infrastructure** in v4.0 — `analyzeSimilarity()` is NOT modified (catalog→similarity rewire is v5.0+)
- Catalog source-of-truth: catalog wins for SPEC fields; per-user `watches` wins for OWNERSHIP fields (CAT-11)
- /evaluate is **auth-only** in v4.0 (anonymous redirect to /signin); demo path deferred to v4.x
- BottomNav stays at 5 slots (Profile is top-right NOT bottom-nav per universal convention)
- DKIM verification MUST complete BEFORE flipping "Confirm email" toggle ON (Phase 21 ordering gate)
- ENUM cleanup uses rename + recreate (`ALTER TYPE … DROP VALUE` does not exist in Postgres)

### Todos

See `.planning/PROJECT.md` `## Requirements` → `### Active` for the carried-forward backlog (test debt + custom SMTP + v3.0 deferred items). Most items are now scheduled into v4.0 phases (TEST-04/05/06 → Phase 24; SMTP → Phase 21; WYWT auto-nav → Phase 26; `wornPublic` fixture cleanup → Phase 24).

### Blockers

None.
