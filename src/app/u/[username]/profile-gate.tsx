/**
 * Server-side profile shell gate — viewer-dependent branching outside the
 * cached scope (D-39c-05, T-39c-01 / T-39c-04 mitigations). Receives `viewerId`
 * from the page (the runtime-API consumer) so this gate is a pure async
 * function of `(username, viewerId, children)`.
 *
 * Load-bearing invariants:
 *   (a) `notFound()` MUST be called BEFORE any post-suspending `await`
 *       (Pitfall 5 — loading.md:118-124). It is called immediately after the
 *       resolver returns null, before `isFollowing` or `resolveCommonGround`.
 *   (b) `viewerId` is received as a prop and lives OUTSIDE the
 *       `<ProfileShellResolver/>` cached scope (Pitfall 1). The resolver MUST
 *       NOT receive viewerId. This gate physically cannot read cookies — the
 *       invariant is now structural rather than conventional.
 *   (c) `<ProfileShellResolver/>` is called HERE (inside the gate, not in the
 *       layout body) so the locked branch can render `<LockedProfileState/>`
 *       without falling through to the public composition.
 *
 * PROHIBITED inside this file:
 *   - use-cache directive — the gate is the uncached layer; this MUST stay uncached
 *   - next/cache tag/life primitives (gate is uncached by design)
 *   - Reading cookies via any means — viewer identity arrives via the
 *     `viewerId` prop and is the page's responsibility (Pitfall 1 structural lock)
 *   - Importing from `@/lib/auth` — the gate is no longer the cookie boundary
